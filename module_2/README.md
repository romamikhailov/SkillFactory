# Exploratory data analysis
## Project objectives:
 - Track the impact of the living conditions of students aged 15 to 22 on their math performance in order to identify students at an early stage at risk.
 - Select data to build a model that would predict the results of the state exam in mathematics for each student of the school.
## Techniology Stack
This project was build using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.
## About the data
The data is represented by a dataset as a file in the csv format.    
Total records in the dataset: 395

The dataset contains the following data:
  - empty values
  - typos or incorrect values (outliers)
  - numeric variables
  - nominative variables
## Stage of the project
1. First look
2. Identifying and processing typical values
3. Correlation analysis
4. Analysis of nominal variables
5. Conclusion
